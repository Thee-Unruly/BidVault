TITLE: Technical Proposal for Health Information System
CLIENT: Ministry of Health, Kenya
DATE: October 2023

1. Executive Summary
We propose a state-of-the-art Health Information System (HIS) designed to streamline patient records across all 47 counties in Kenya. Our solution leverages mobile-first technology to ensure even rural clinics can access critical data.

2. Technical Methodology
Our approach follows the HL7 FHIR standards for data interoperability. We will implement a distributed database architecture with local caching to handle intermittent internet connectivity in remote areas like Turkana and Marsabit.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation
We will use a results-based framework to track the adoption rate of the system. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include:
- System uptime (target 99.9%)
- Average time to retrieve a patient record (< 2 seconds)
- Number of healthcare workers trained

4. Conclusion
BidVault is uniquely positioned to deliver this project due to our extensive experience with USAID-funded health projects in East Africa.
